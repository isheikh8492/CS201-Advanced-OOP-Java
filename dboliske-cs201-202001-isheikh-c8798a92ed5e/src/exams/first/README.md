# Midterm Exam

You will have 75 minutes to complete this exam. You are not allowed to use any outside notes or resources and doing so will result in a zero on this exam. Make sure to read all the instructions for each question carefully and answer each question completely. Once you have finished, please commit and push you work to your repository. Please confirm that the code is in your remote repository, i.e. that it is on bitbucket.org.

## Question One: Selection

Write a Java program that will prompt the user for a letter. If the letter is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u') print out "Vowel". If the letter is not a vowel, print out "Consonant".

## Question Two: Repetition

Write a Java program that will prompt the user to enter an integer and prints out every positive, even integer less than or equal to that number. For example, if the user enters 6, the program would print out the following:

```
2 4 6
```

## Question Three: Arrays

Write a Java program that will prompt the user for 5 words, which are stored in an array, and returns the word that occurs last alphabetically.

**NOTE:** 

- Your program must use an array.
- Do not sort the array or use ArrayLists.

## Question Four: Objects

Write a Java class based on the following UML diagram. Include all standard methods, such as constructors, mutators, accessors, toString, and equals. Additionally, implement any methods shown in the diagram.

**NOTES:**

- Please make sure that the circle's radius is positive.
- area = Math.Pi x radius x radius
- circumference = 2.0 x Math.Pi x radius
