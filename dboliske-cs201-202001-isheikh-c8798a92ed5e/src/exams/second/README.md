# Final Exam

You will have until May 4th at midnight CDT (that's the midnight between Monday and Tuesday) to complete this exam. It is opened notes and opened book, but all code must be your own. Make sure to read all the instructions for each question carefully and answer each question completely. Once you have finished, please commit and push you work to your repository. Please confirm that the code is in your remote repository, i.e. that it is on bitbucket.org.

## Question One: Inheritance/Polymorphism/Abstract Classes

Write the Java classes based on the following UML diagram. Include all standard methods, such as constructors, mutators, accessors, toString, and equals. Additionally, implement all methods shown in the diagram. (**Note**: You can use either 3.14 or Math.PI for the value of pi. Also, the area method refers to the surface area of the box.)

## Question Two: ArrayLists

Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter a sequence of non-negative numbers (0 or more), storing them in an ArrayList, and continues prompting the user for numbers until they enter a negative value. When they have finished entering non-negative numbers, your program should return the mode (most commonly entered) of the values entered.

## Question Three: Sorting

Write a Java program that implements Insertion Sort and sorts the following Array reverse alphabetically, printing the results to the console.

```
{"five", "three", "eight", "one", "two", "four", "nine", "seven", "six", "ten"}
```

## Question Four: Searching

Write a Java program that implements recursive Binary Search for an Array (or ArrayList) of Strings. Your program should prompt the user for the term they wish to search for and return the position of the term within the Array (or ArrayList). If the term is not present, it should return -1. Use the following for testing:

```
{"biology", "cubism", "grim", "iris", "jackal", "lance", "mourning", "newt", "potassium", "yeti"}
```

NOTE: You do not need to sort the data as it has already been sorted.
