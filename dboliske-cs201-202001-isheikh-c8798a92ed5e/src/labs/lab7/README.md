# Lab 7 - Recursion, Searching, and Sorting

## 04/06/2020

## Objectives

1.  Learn to use sorting algorithms
2.  Learn to use searching algorithms
3.  Learn to use recursion in the implementation of algorithms

## Exercises

1.  Write a Java program that will implement the Bubble Sort algorithm as a method and sort the following array of integers:
    <pre>{10, 4, 7, 3, 8, 6, 1, 2, 5, 9}</pre>
2.  Write a Java program that will implement the Insertion Sort algorithm as a method and sort the following array of Strings:
    <pre>{"cat", "fat", "dog", "apple", "bat", "egg"}</pre>
3.  Write a Java program that will implement the Binary Search algorithm as a recursive method and be able to search the following array of Strings for a specific value, input by the user:
    <pre>{"c", "html", "java", "python", "ruby", "scala"}</pre>
