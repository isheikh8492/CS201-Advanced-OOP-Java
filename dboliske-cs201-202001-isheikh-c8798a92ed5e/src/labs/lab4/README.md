2. Learn to write instance variables and necessary methods in a class
3. Learn to test the Classes

## Exercise ##

### Performance Criteria ###

1. *Can write Java methods in a class.*
  * Can write a method with a return type, method name, parameter list, and a method body.
  * Can write a method with correct syntax.
2. *Can write a class.*
  * Can identify and declare instance variable(s).
  * Can write usual accessor and mutator methods for a class.
  * Can write constructors for a class.
  * Can write other required methods in a class such as toString()
3. *Can write an application class to test a class.*
  * Can instantiate objects of a class.
  * Can call methods to display objects' data.

### Assignment ###

#### Part I: GeoLocation Class ####
Write the class, *GeoLocation.java*. You can refer to *Name.java* used in the lecture to complete the below exercises. Do the following:
1. Create two instance variables, lat and lng, both of which should be doubles.
2. Write the default constructor.
3. Write the non-default constructor.
4. Write 2 accessor methods, one for each instance variable.
5. Write 2 mutator methods, one for each instance variable.
6. Write a method that will return the location in the format "(*lat*, *lng*)" (the toString method).
7. Write a method that will return true if the latitude is between -90 and +90.
8. Write a method that will return true if the longitude is between -180 and +180.
9. **Optional**: Write a method that will take a String in the format "(*lat*, *lng*)" and return a GeoLocation.
10. Now write an application class that instantiates two instances of *GeoLocation*. One instance should use the default constructor and the other should use the non-default constructor. Display the values of the instance variables by calling the accessor methods.

#### Part II: PhoneNumber Class ####
Write the class, *PhoneNumber.java*. Do the following:
1. Create three instance variables, countryCode, areaCode and number, all of which should be Strings.
2. Write the default constructor.
3. Write the non-default constructor.
4. Write 3 accessor methods, one for each instance variable.
5. Write 3 mutator methods, one for each instance variable.
6. Write a method that will return the entire phone number as a single string (the toString method).
7. Write a method that will return true if the areaCode is 3 characters long.
8. Write a method that will return true if the number is 7 characters long.
9. **Optional**: 7 and 8 return true if the areaCode is 3 digit characters long and the number is 7 digit characters long.
10. Now write an application class that instantiates two instances of *PhoneNumber*. One instance should use the default constructor and the other should use the non-default constructor. Display the values of each object by calling the toString method.
